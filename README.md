👋 Hi, I’m @sziller, an Engineer and M.Sc. Architect with decentralization and self-sufficiency on my mind. 
👀 I’m interested in Engineering soultions for real life problems accessible to anyone, with skunkworks philosophy.  
I strive to achieve optimal-redundancy by cutting out as many middle men off systems as possible. I love solutions that _work_, even if rough on the edges.  
🌱 I’m currently learning How to *manage a complex Open-source project* made up of
  * hardware (IT) - selection, setup, controlling
  * software (IT) - design, implementation, testing, documentation
    * system management Engine
    * optimization Engine: self-learning system
    * rest api based front-back remote and local communication
  * physical, environmental measurements - oracle management, sensors, Bitcoin-blockchain based data validation
  * biological system - aquaponic setup with fish veggies and possibly mushrooms
  * intelligent shell - a building housing and entire development
  * civil engineering - electricity, piping, ventillation
  * decentralized energy generation - active and passive methods
  * energy management - passive heat storages and bitcoin mining: both serving as buffers.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - well basically - any of the topics mentioned above, first and foremost on software and open software development management related issues.
